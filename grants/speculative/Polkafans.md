# Polkadot Chinese Community

## Project Description
We are a blockchain technology organization from Hangzhou, China. The name is [Crypto Geek](http://site-383706-7184-4132.sxl.cn/), Chinese name is 密码极客. We hope to organize Polkafans — a Polkadot Chinese community.

>The plan is to launch the Polkadot Chinese community(Polkafans) organization in Hangzhou, and expand the influence of Polkadot to the entire technology enthusiasts in China, and broaden the Chinese market for the development of Polkadot Ecosystem. We established contact with the Web 3 Foundation as early as October 2018 and organized a Polkadot technical seminar. We invited [Yue Lipeng](https://twitter.com/yuelipeng) from [ChainX](https://chainx.org/), [Jiang Fuyao (0xthreebody)](https://twitter.com/0xThreeBody) from [Polkawallet](https://polkawallet.io/), and a large number of technology developers in Hangzhou to carry out technical sharing and in-depth discussion about Polkadot and Substrate, and got the praise of Hangzhou blockchain. After that, we established the online community of Polkadot, built a community of fans on WeChat, and we also have established the [WeChat Public Account](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/profile_ext?action=home&__biz=Mzg4MzAxODYxMg==&scene=124#wechat_redirect) of the Polkadot Community and opened the Polkadot community column on our official [website](http://www.mimajike.com/). and kept the updates of at least two articles per week. We will publish relevant articles around the latest Polkadot news and the deepest technology sharing, and push the articles to [Sohu News](http://news.sohu.com/), [Tencent News](https://news.qq.com/), [Interface News](https://www.jiemian.com/), [Cointime](https://www.jinse.com/), [Mars Finance](https://www.huoxing24.com/), [Chainnews](https://www.chainnews.com/), CC-Value and other cooperative media channels, to gradually develop the growth of community members. And we did the [Polkadot online sharing event](https://tokenclub.com/room/10300) on November 23, 2018, invited [Thibaut Sardan](https://twitter.com/Tbaut) to have in-depth conversations with the technicians of the Crypto Geek, and got more than 130,000 page traffic. After more than three months of continuous operation and growth, our community members have reached 1500+, they also have increased the  recognition of us. Therefore, we decided to establish the real Polkadot Chinese community which will become the first community in China, and gather Chinese Polkadot fans to build the Polkadot Ecosystem together，which is named Polkafans！
